What is a WikiWalkeur?
======================

* A WikiWalkeur is someone who is in the process of performing a kind of Manual Web Crawling.
* He/She/They start with a hyperlink or set of such links - i.e. a Seed - and performs a WikiWalk on at least one of them, up to and including ALL of them, also possibly including ALL of them AND other Hyperlinks Found Along The Way.
* This is what a WikiWalk is, literally for LACK of a better term. Manual or Analog Web Crawling is the only alternative I have found thus far, and is is a rather crude description of what the process really is all about.
* The point is that you can do better than Google's own web crawler(s), because you have Human Intelligence.

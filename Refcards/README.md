Refcards

Modeling Moral Temperature. First, let us take inspiration from Observations and Measurements Schemas.

O&M defines a core set of properties for an observation:
* feature of interest
* observed property
* result
* procedure - the instrument, algorithm or process used (which may be described using SensorML)
* phenomenon time - the real-world time associated with the result
* result time - the time when the result was generated
* valid time - the period during which the result may be used

The core properties of sampling features are:
* sampled feature - which links the sampling artefact with the real-world feature of interest
* related observation
* related sampling feature - linking sampling features into complexes

DEFINITIONS:
* The Refcard is similar to a Quickref or Reference Card, as well as a Card from a Library Card Catalog and a Spec sheet or Datasheet.
* The Refcard is meant to be a "quick reference".

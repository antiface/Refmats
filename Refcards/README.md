Refcards
========
Modeling Moral Temperature. First, let us take inspiration from Observations and Measurements Schemas.

O&M defines a core set of properties for an observation:
* feature of interest
* observed property
* result
* procedure - the instrument, algorithm or process used (which may be described using SensorML)
* phenomenon time - the real-world time associated with the result
* result time - the time when the result was generated
* valid time - the period during which the result may be used

The core properties of sampling features are:
* sampled feature - which links the sampling artefact with the real-world feature of interest
* related observation
* related sampling feature - linking sampling features into complexes

DEFINITIONS:
* The Refcard is similar to a Quickref or Reference Card, as well as a Card from a Library Card Catalog and a Spec sheet or Datasheet.
* The Refcard is meant to be a "quick reference".
* In the case of the type of Refcard called the MoralTempCard ("moral temperature reference card"), we are making Observations on the "Moral Climate" or "Moral Temperature".
* Ergo, the feature of interest and/or observed property is a feature/property of the moral climate.
* What is the Moral Climate? It is a mixture of the Milieu, the Moment, and the populations inhabiting the habitat at time t.

TOKENS & TYPES:
* Cards represent a deep structure, oftentimes called Deep Logic.
* They are intentional subtypes, representing directional motility in geo-grammar.
* The biotic life-form is always in an Incunabula; it is an Incunabulist, through the Historiome.
* The basic type of the historiomic token, a.k.a. Refcard, IS The Tribuna of The Uffizi.
* It IS the Exhibition-Painting, The Inhibition-Poem, the epitome of "Theatrical Constraint".
* See: Theatrum Pictorium, Image-of-Discourse, Image-AS-Discourse, the Mosaic-Painting Painting Mosaics.
* See also: The Ideal of The Temple of Painting, ABC of Architecture, Florilegio Spirituale.

* [What is (a) Reference?] (http://beautifulsignals.tumblr.com/post/79431684007/welcome-to-the-abstract-handbook)
* [Okay, no. What is a Reference, exactly?] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars_longa,_vita_brevis)

## Here is a Reference:

* Is this a proper REFERENCE? =>

_Ars longa, vita brevis is a Latin translation of an aphorism coming originally from Greek. The Latin quote is often rendered in English as Art is long, life is short._
_The aphorism quotes the first two lines of the Aphorismi by the Ancient Greek physician Hippocrates. The familiar Latin translation Ars longa, vita brevis reverses the order of the original lines._
- [Ars longa, vita brevis] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars_longa,_vita_brevis)

* Again, no. Not really. That was a quotation, or excerpt from [Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)
* That was a [Hyperlink] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink). So was that, just now, the linking part.
* Is a hyperlink a Reference? Not really, it's more like a Pointer.
* Is the URL a REFERENCE? Yes, pretty much, it definitely does Reference Something.

* 3x3 WINDOW OPERATIONS
* EXAMPLE:

### [] [] []
### [] [] []
### [] [] []

* THAT, ABOVE HERE, IS A 3x3 "MATRIX" OR WHAT I AM CALLING A "WINDOW" HERE.
* I CAN TAKE 9 OF THESE 3x3 WINDOWS (the smallest "atomic window") =>
	=> IT WILL GIVE ME THE SAME TYPE OF WINDOW, BUT MULTIPLIED BY A FACTOR OF 3, IF YOU WILL
* So I start with the 3x3 "atomic window" and =>
	=> I ADD 9 of those, making a second order atomic window of its own AND ALSO =>
	=> I ADD 9 OF THOSE, NOW, MAKING A 3rd ORDER 3x3 ATOMIC WINDOW =>
* AND THAT'S ABOUT ALL I NEED RIGHT NOW.
